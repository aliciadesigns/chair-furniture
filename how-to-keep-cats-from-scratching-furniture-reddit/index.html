<p>How to stop your cat scratching furniture. A cheap two in one solution is Alpha Paws dog ramp that also doubles as a cat scratcher and ramp that cats love to run up and down on while small dogs can use it to safely get on and off a couch. For example lets say your cat goes over to one of the chair and starts to scratch. Ive been at it for eight months now and shes become much better about using her many many scratching posts.

<p>Immediately slam your hands HARD onto whatever is nearby - floor wall table desk - and yell NO in a deep loud voice. You can also try coating the places she scratches with tin foil or double sided tape. Simply squeeze the lemon and apply juice on furniture where your cat started to scratch. Another common home remedy to scratching is the mix of water eucalyptus oil and lemongrass oil which can be rubbed or sprayed on the furniture where your cat usually scratches.

<p>If you have more than one cat consider getting two or more scratching posts as some cats will take ownership preventing others from using a particular scratching post. The next method is to make a citrus oil mix. They will sink their claws in it like three times and that will stop them. It will stop clawing the decors within a few days.
