<p>We only recently purchased an RV for travel so prior to that all our travel was by car. If you have to travel alone be sure not to increase your cats stress by playing loud music. Lots of great tips and ideas for all of you who travel with cats. If possible travel with someone your cat knows and likes so you can sit with your cat to ease their nerves by talking to them in a soothing voice and petting them.
