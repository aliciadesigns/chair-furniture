<p><strong>How To Stop Cat From Putting Paws In Water</strong>, Be safe and place the bowl in a shallow under-the-bed plastic storage box. Elevating the dish may also help but for large-breed deep-chested dogs elevated feeding bowls are associated with a higher risk of bloat so talk with your veterinarian before switching. He will paw at the water splash it around then slowly and carefully lower his head to drink half the time he will lower it too low and he will inhale water through his nose or he will be too high and have to lower his head to where he will.

<p>Cats who splish their water before drinking may in fact be attempting to achieve a similar effect. Next provide multiple sources of water including runnin. If you find that your cat is dipping its paws into a water dish or glass and then licking off the moisture it could just be the way your cat likes to drink. As for the water bowl I suggest getting a water fountain. Shell sit at her water bowl and will do this for a good 10 minutes or so.</p>
