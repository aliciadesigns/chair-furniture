<p>Also if the design engineer was tasked to create a chair at those weight restrictions and they are fairly competent at their job they probably designed the chair with a safety factor of 15 and therefore the maximum weight the chair is designed for is 225 lbs. Of course if you weigh 300lb and you sit on a chair with a 150lb weight limit there is a high chance that the chair will collapse under you. After doing some research I found out a couple of interesting findings Id like to share. However if you weigh 400lb and sit on a 200lb-rated chair the office chair may break.
