<p>Anesthetic agents have distinct effects on cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism 1415 which may have implications for beach chair positioning. 1 2 This position affords better intra-articular visualization and less risk of neurovascular trauma than when patients are placed in the lateral decubitus position LDP. Note risk of jugular venous obstruction with excessive neck flexion. According to a report by Murphy et al3 shoulder surgery in the beach chair position was associated with a significant reduction in cerebral oxygenation.</p>

<p>According to a report by Murphy et al3 shoulder surgery in the beach chair position was associated with a significant reduction in cerebral oxygenation. 1described how they used the application of positive end-expiratory pressure and the beach chair position to counteract the respiratory derangements in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric surgery. Note risk of jugular venous obstruction with excessive neck flexion. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of intravenous general anesthesia and controlled hypotension on cerebral saturation rScO 2 cerebral blood flow measured as middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity Vmax MCA and neurobehavioral outcome in patients scheduled for shoulder surgery in beach chair position.

<p>Reduced cerebral perfusion seems to occur frequently during shoulder surgery in the beach chair position BCP primarily in patients under general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation which may be magnified by deliberate hypotension. At our insti-tution we performed a small study with institutional review board approval com-paring mechanical ventilation to sponta-neous ventilation both general anesthesia. In ASA I-II patients intravenous general anesthesia and controlled hypotension in the beach chair position affects cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation with impact on the neurobehavioral outcome.
