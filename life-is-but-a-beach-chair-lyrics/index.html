<p><strong>Life Is But A Beach Chair Lyrics</strong>, Chris Martin Verse 3 Life is but a dream to me Cant mimic my life Im the thinnest cut slice Intercut the winners cup With winters rough enough To interrupt life Thats why Im both The saint and the sinner Nice This is Jay everyday No compromise.

No compass comes with this life just eyes. So fly you shall so have no fear just know that life is just but a beach chair Chorus.</p>
