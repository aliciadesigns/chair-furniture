<p>Even the toughest leather couches cant take the daily scratching and clawing of dog and cat nails without showing a little wear eventually. The damage a cats claws does to leather cant be buffed or polished out. They are soft plastic tips that glue onto the nails and prevent them from scratching inappropriately. Put plastic caps on your cats claws if she still scratches your leather furniture even with a scratching post nearby.
