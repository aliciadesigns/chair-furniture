<p>In my opinion no material does better for scratch and spill prevention overall though velvet can be a little more hard-wearing when it comes to weathering scratches and pleather can be a smidgen better at handling spills. Capped claws nail-friendly covers and even scratching posts can keep your couch in pristine condition. By thinking ahead and planning your purchase in advance you can avoid a lot of problems further down the line. But its not the best couch material for cats. Pin On D I Y Home Improvement.</p>
