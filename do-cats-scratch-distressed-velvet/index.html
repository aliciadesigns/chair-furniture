<p><strong>Do Cats Scratch Distressed Velvet</strong>, Velvet is a woven fabric but the threads are cut to give the fabric a short pile. And it works for most fabrics not just velvet. Also it has no loose threads or raised weaves that are prone to snagging. Also most cats dont like to claw it because it lacks that woven texture.</p>

<p>Applying a protective coating such as Scotchguard helps it weather stains and spills even better. Microfiber is a smooth soft fabric and those qualities are the opposite of what cats like in terms of texture. In my opinion no material does better for scratch and spill prevention overall though velvet can be a little more hard-wearing when it comes to weathering scratches and pleather can be a smidgen better at handling spills. And commercial-grade fabrics nylon and polyester repel stains more easily. In fact a lot of fabrics are sticky My Palecek chairs were a favorite of Peaches.</p>
