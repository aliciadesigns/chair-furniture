<p>We help you find the right equipment first time every time. Whats more pets usually love having a regular brush down particularly if summer is approaching and they are starting to molt. For lots of hair toss the clothes in a dryer for a few minutes along with a dryer sheet. Just toss in the dryer on laundry day. Pin On House Design Help.</p>

<p>Use a dry kitchen sponge or any other upholstery to get rid of the pet hair from your couches. Simply roll it over your fabric couch and it will do its job. All you need are rubber kitchen gloves and a small bowl of water. The sponge should be just dump and no water should come out when you squeeze it. Pin On CurÄÈenie UÈoarÄ.</p>
