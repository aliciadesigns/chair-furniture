<p>Use a dry kitchen sponge or any other upholstery to get rid of the pet hair from your couches. Simply roll it over your fabric couch and it will do its job. All you need are rubber kitchen gloves and a small bowl of water. The sponge should be just dump and no water should come out when you squeeze it. Pin On Curățenie Ușoară.</p>
