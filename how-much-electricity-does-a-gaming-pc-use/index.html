<p>Really good and usually expensive PSUs are 90. So it is obvious to find out how much electricity does a gaming computer use. This translates to up to 1400 kWh annually and is six times higher than a laptops power usage. During gaming gaming computers use 250-550W.

<p>200 watts multiplied by 24 hours divided by 1000 multiplied by 365 days in the year equals 1752 kilowatt-hours kWh. The power usage of a PC depends on both the hardware and how often it is used. I reckon a gaming PC with monitor would be unlikely to draw more than 300W on average even if it does have a 600W PSU so that would be 36p a day. To put that in perspective a typical gaming console uses around 134 kilowatt hours while an average household PC will consum3 246 kilowatt hours. Pin On Tech And Technology.</p>

<p>However measurements show that the peak power potential for much of this hardware is considerably lower than most component manufacturers are willing to admit. Obviously a powerful gaming PC with top-of-the-line components will use more electricity under load than a Chromebox with a low-power CPU. If your PC uses 300 watts while gaming then one hour of play time would cost you just under 4 cents. Do gaming computers use a lot of electricity.
