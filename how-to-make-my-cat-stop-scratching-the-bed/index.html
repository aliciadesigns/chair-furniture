<p>One thing you could do and is really effective is. However lately starting at about 3 or 4am shes been scratching at my sheets or bed comforter constantly. I think it is likely that the cat is anxious since she is new maybe you could try to tire her out as much as you can at night before bed so she sleeps more and you too also try to ignore her bad behavior although from what I read her will smash your door I think you could watch some videos on how you can try to strengthen the relationship with the cat so she is not so anxious. Firstly clean the damaged area to remove any trace of the pheromone scent that will be encouraging your cat to keep scratching.
