<p>Beach chair positioning during general anesthesia is associated with cerebral oxygen desaturation. Anesthesia and found significant reduc-tions in cerebral oxygenation in patients in the beach-chair position as opposed to the lateral decubitus position. Reduced cerebral perfusion seems to occur frequently during shoulder surgery in the beach chair position BCP primarily in patients under general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation which may be magnified by deliberate hypotension. The current study was designed to evaluate whether the beach chair position before and during general anesthesia differentially induces changes in cerebral oxygenation as determined by near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS in surgical patients. After positioning hypo-tension was induced and maintained at a target mean arterial pressure MAP of 60 to 65 mm Hg with continuous infusion of remifentanil.</p>

<p>1 2 This position affords better intra-articular visualization and less risk of neurovascular trauma than when patients are placed in the lateral decubitus position LDP. Reduced cerebral perfusion seems to occur frequently during shoulder surgery in the beach chair position BCP primarily in patients under general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation which may be magnified by deliberate hypotension. Cerebral blood flow is at risk when cerebral blood pressure falls below.
