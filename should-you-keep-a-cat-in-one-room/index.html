<p>Kittens can be let out of one room as they adjust to their surroundings or if you have other pets your new kitten needs to. Practice patience until your kitty is ready to interact with everyone else. When to let your cat outside Its important that your cat stays confined to the house for at least two weeks as this will allow them time to get used to their new territory.
