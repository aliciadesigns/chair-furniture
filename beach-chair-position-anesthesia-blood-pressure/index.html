<p>Beachchair and Blood Pressure. Shoulder surgery is another option and the sitting position decreases brachial plexus stretch and aids in manipulation of the joint. The difference between the two is the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the brain and the location in which the BP is being measured. After the induction of anesthesia patients were put into the beach-chair position using a beach-chair table T-MAX beach chair. We retrospectively investigated whether maintaining the arterial blood pressure ABP prevented the decrease in the regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation rSO2.</p>
