<p>Cats are allergic to vinegar. The easiest way to keep your cat or dog from ruining your leather sofa is strategically placing pet toys near it. For our leather couches anytime the cats accidentally or unintentionally scratch the leather I use this leather conditioner and put a little on a clean towel and rub it into the spot vigorously for about 5 seconds and it practically removes the mark especially after a few coats. You can cover the leather couch with a throw or a slipcover you can look into a product called SSSCat. 19 Cleaning Tips Every Dog Or Cat Owner Should Know Keep Dog Off Couch Cleaning Hacks Cat Owners.</p>
